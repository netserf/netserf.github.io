Playing with GitHub pages.

GitHub Pages Site: [netserf.github.io](https://netserf.github.io)

## Was it a 404?

- Seems like the site times out after a while - i.e. shows a 404 page.
- Workaround:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m 'trigger rebuild'
git push
```

## TODOs

- Determine how to manage these site time-outs
